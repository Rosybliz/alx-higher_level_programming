This project is about implemnting the doctest 
Test Driven Development.
This does not replace or bypass python documentation 
rather it helps you test your code non-interactively
There are different types of TDD and they are Unittesting, Pytesting and
Doctesting(which is our main focus for this project)

Unittest comes in handy when you are working with larger code.
